# 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
## Description
What you should learn from this project:

- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
# Initialization

## 7-puts_half.c
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
## 8-print_array.c
